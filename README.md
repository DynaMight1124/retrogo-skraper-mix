# RG Nano Skraper Mix
## Inspired by Tiny Best Set and forked from [garlic-onion-skraper-mix](https://github.com/ebzero/garlic-onion-skraper-mix) by **[EBZero](https://github.com/ebzero)**!
### Optimimized with (ðŸ§¨) for tiny devices

If you've ever tried to generate media for your game collection on the RG Nano, you may have beeb shocked when you saw the results. This pretty much summs up the experience:

![What's this? A game list for ANTS?!?](https://github.com/tobio-tenma/files/blob/main/RG-Nano-Scraper-Mix/gamelist-for-ants.jpg)

Use this mix to generate media (example below) for your RG Nano. The game logos are scaled so they are easier to read and overlayed on a screen-shot. Generally works well for most of the themes included with the device.

Here is some sample output created by the RG Nano Skraper Mix:

|                                       |                                       |                                       |

## Stage 1 - Scrape Your Media with the Template Using Skraper

Generally, you want to follow the **[excellent instructions](https://github.com/ebzero/garlic-onion-skraper-mix#garlic-onion-skraper-mix)** created by [EB Zero](https://github.com/ebzero) and simply select the RG Nano XML template rather than the one made for Garlic/Onion devices.

Here is what's different from the original instructions. This all on the *Media* tab:
- **Output folder** should be set to **`%ROMROOTFOLDER%`**.
- **Gamelist Link** should be set to *No Link. Store one media per game/rom*.

A sample of the above settings is as shown:

## Stage 2 - Convert PNGs to JPGs w/ optional Clean-Up (Not Required)
### Note: This stage is **completely optional**. It will reduce the file size and should be (in theory) slightly more efficient on the limited hardware provided. Once again, **this is optional** and comes down to personal preference.

The **[PowerShell script](https://github.com/tobio-tenma/rg-nano-skraper-mix/blob/main/New-JpgsFromSkraper.ps1) creates JPG images from Skraper's PNG images. There is functinoality built-in to optionally purge the PNG files as after each successful JPG creation.

### Instructions ###

#### Quickstart
- Open a [Terminal](https://www.howtogeek.com/831728/7-ways-to-open-windows-terminal-on-windows-11/) at the location of the provided PowerShell script.
- Call the script as shown below in *Example 1* substituting "**`E:\`**" with the correct drive as according to your system.
  - Alternatively, provide the directory containing the scraped systems.
- *If you do not know the correct drive, open **File Explorer** and check **This PC** for the correct drive.*


#### Example 1 - Preserve Originals
Creates JPGs from the PNG files. No cleanup is performed:
```
.\New-JpgsFromSkraper.ps1 "E:\"
```
Note: The "E:\" could be different depending on your system configuration. Please double check to avoid issues.

#### Example 2 - Purge Originals
Creates JPGs from the PNG files. Cleans up by deleting PNGs successfully converted to JPG through the optional ``$true`` argument :
```
.\New-JpgsFromSkraper.ps1 "E:\" $true
```
Note: The "E:\" could be different depending on your system configuration. Please double check to avoid issues.

#### Conclusion
After running the script, your RG Nano / micro SD card can be safely ejected and removed and placed back into device.
